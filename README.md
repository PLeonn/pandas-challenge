Analysis - also included at the end of my .ipynb file:
#1: This player base is VASTLY male-dominated.
#2: Almost a true majority of players (46.8%) is between the ages of 20-24, with the majority of purchases also falling in that age range with the same percent.
    #It would seem that people are buying themselves the game, since the percentages are equal.
#3: Average value purchased was $3 per person. Top spenders paid up to $19 for their purchases. Roughly 95% are paying considerably under $10 per purchase."
